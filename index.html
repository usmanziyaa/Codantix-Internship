    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is Usman Zia, a 20-year-old undergraduate student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) at Mohammad Ali Jinnah University, where I am enrolled in the 3rd semester. Alongside my academic journey, I have recently started an internship focused on frontend development, where I am gaining hands-on experience with modern web technologies including Tailwind CSS, React.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This opportunity is allowing me to strengthen my technical skills and build a strong foundation for my career in software development.</p>
